# CS1501API

linke to the tutorial: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map


I used the API to build a map that can locate in any place on the map according to my given parameters.
I used the function InitMap. In the function, I set a variable called map, and create a map object and assign the object to the variable. We also use the zoom parameter to set how large the scale of the map is, and the latitude and longitude of the location we want to find. All these three variables are passed to the function as parameters.
Also, in the function, I set a marker to it with the location of my hometown, Nanjing, China.
